## functions

The project was completed using three functions:

1. addSection() function:
    a function to add list items to the navbar dynamically.

2. secInView() function:
    a function that checks if the section is in view.

3. activeSectionStyle() function:
    a function that uses the currentSection() to check for the currently view section and adds a different styling to it.
